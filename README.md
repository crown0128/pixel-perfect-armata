# Armata
An adaptive semantic web layout with accessibility. Built without libraries and frameworks. SCSS & Vanilla JS. I built this project to improve my skills in BEM methodology, semantic layout, and accessibility.
The PSD template was found [here](https://webdesign-master.ru/blog/html-css/546.html).
